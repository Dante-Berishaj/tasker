/api/lists/{id}/tasks didnt let me process data even though i gave the 
bearer token in postman so I had to do it by filtering the tasks 
task_list_id property with the current lists id

{
    "success": false,
    "message": "Unauthorized for this action",
    "code": 401
}

In new category screen i used a select to show 4 colors for the new category. Could've added more.


no redux
not responsive

to run: the standard npm i => npm start, didnt do any shenanigans.
